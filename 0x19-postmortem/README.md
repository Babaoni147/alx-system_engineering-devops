# Postmortem Report: Web Stack Debugging Project Outage

## Issue Summary

**Duration of the Outage:**  
- **Start Time:** August 15, 2024, 14:00 UTC
- **End Time:** August 15, 2024, 15:30 UTC

**Impact:**  
- **Service Affected:** Main website and API endpoints
- **User Experience:** Users experienced 502 Bad Gateway errors and significant latency.
- **Affected Users:** Approximately 80% of the user base

**Root Cause:**  
- The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to improper routing of traffic, causing the backend servers to become overwhelmed and eventually crash.

## Timeline

- **14:00 UTC:** Issue detected via monitoring alerts indicating a spike in 502 errors.
- **14:02 UTC:** On-call engineer began initial investigation.
- **14:10 UTC:** Customer complaints started coming in, confirming widespread impact.
- **14:15 UTC:** Backend server logs and load balancer settings were reviewed.
- **14:20 UTC:** Assumption that the issue was related to recent deployment changes.
- **14:30 UTC:** Rollback of the latest deployment did not resolve the issue.
- **14:45 UTC:** Escalated to the DevOps team for deeper investigation.
- **15:00 UTC:** Misconfiguration in the load balancer identified.
- **15:10 UTC:** Load balancer settings corrected.
- **15:20 UTC:** System recovery observed, and services began stabilizing.
- **15:30 UTC:** Full resolution confirmed, and all services were operational.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The primary cause of the outage was an incorrect load balancer configuration. A recent update to the load balancer's settings inadvertently altered the routing rules, leading to a scenario where a disproportionate amount of traffic was directed to a subset of backend servers. This caused those servers to become overwhelmed, resulting in 502 Bad Gateway errors and significant latency for end users.

**Resolution:**  
To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
1. The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings was identified by the DevOps team.
2. The incorrect routing rules were corrected to ensure balanced traffic distribution across all backend servers.
3. A comprehensive review of the load balancer configuration was conducted to prevent similar issues in the future.
4. Once the settings were updated, the backend servers began to recover, and normal service was gradually restored.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**
1. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement more granular monitoring and alerting for load balancer traffic patterns and server health.
2. **Configuration Reviews:** Regularly review and audit load balancer and server configurations to ensure correctness.
3. **Deployment Process:** Strengthen the deployment process with more rigorous testing and validation steps, especially for critical infrastructure components.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
1. **Patch Load Balancer:** Update the load balancer configuration management to include checks for routing rule correctness.
2. **Add Monitoring:** Implement additional monitoring on load balancer traffic distribution and backend server load.
3. **Conduct Training:** Provide training for the engineering team on best practices for load balancer and server configuration.
4. **Implement Rollback Plan:** Develop a more effective rollback strategy to quickly revert to known good configurations in case of issues.
5. **Review Incident Response:** Conduct a post-incident review meeting to analyze the response process and identify areas for improvement.
